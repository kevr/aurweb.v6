aurweb [Django Port]
--------------------

This project is intended to be a continued replacement for an
existing PHP-implemented aurweb. This django port contributes
the following improvements to aurweb from a developer perspective:

* Model-based ORM
* Automated REST content serialization
* Easy to integrate HTTP transport middlewares
* Simplified reasoning of codebase from reviewer's perspective
* Structured framework

And as for the user-view improvements:

* Standardize v6 API across the board (multiple by predicates)
* POST requests now work across all API requests

Many additional improvements are to be added as soon as possible.
